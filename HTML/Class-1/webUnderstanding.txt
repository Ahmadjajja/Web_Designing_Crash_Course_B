Below code is written as high level code.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Voluptas,
      accusamus.
    </p>
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5</h1>
    <h6>Heading 6</h6>
  </body>
</html>



Problem
    problem is that machine /  computer / web browser don't understand this code.

What machine actually understands?
    Machine only understand code written in 0s and 1s form called machine code / binary code / low level code.


                High Level code

                       |
                Low Level code  - machine only understand this code

first hand programming                0101010101010110100010000111
second hand programming               add = 1001010100101010101010  -> refers to assembly language
last hand programming                 add = 2 + 3



How browser understand HTML code?
1- V8 Engine first parse / analyse the HTML file that what is available in this file like
    what are the tags, their attributes, their values and finally what's the text is written
2- V8 engine creates the DOM(Document Object Model) of the html file that tells the browser how information will be display browser
3- V8 engine convert code to machine code and display on webbrowser
